## Credit Default Prediction Model
This Jupyter notebook contains an example of how to build a machine learning model to predict credit default using a dataset of 5380 records, each characterized by 19 distinct features 

The dataset consists of date values, numerical entries, and categorical variables. The goal is to execute a **classification task**, which is unique due to the dataset's imbalance. To tackle this issue, methods such as resampling or using a model specifically designed for handling such cases are explored. The performance of the model is assessed using accuracy and ROC AUC score, which are standard metrics in classification tasks
